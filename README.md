# NS-3-GUI-in-PYgames
Our aim is to design a simulation environment for testing and learning different
Vulnerabilities in LTE architecture. We have used a Network simulator called NS-3.
Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) is an open-source network simulation platform. It is a
tool used by academics and developers to investigate network behavior and build and
test new networking protocols. Ns-3 provides a versatile and configurable simulation
environment that allows users to model many sorts of networks and network behaviors.
It also includes a set of tools for evaluating and displaying simulation results. Ns-3 is
written in C++ and Python and distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License.

In the final evaluation for capstone two, we will have a simulation environment
for LTE. This tool can be used for education as it can demonstrate two major
LTE attacks. It can be open-sourced for other people to work and build on top of the
code. NS3 is well known for its simulation capabilities but until now there have been
very few tools for representing nodes in GUI. This can be a starting point for a generic
system used for other research purposes. This is achieved by the fact that all of the
modules that I have made in PYgames are separate objects that can be called for any
dynamic application.
