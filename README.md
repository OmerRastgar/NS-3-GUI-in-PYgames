# NS-3-GUI-in-PYgames
Our aim is to design a simulation environment for testing and learning different
Vulnerabilities in LTE architecture. We have used a Network simulator called NS-3.
Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) is an open-source network simulation platform. It is a
tool used by academics and developers to investigate network behavior and build and
test new networking protocols. Ns-3 provides a versatile and configurable simulation
environment that allows users to model many sorts of networks and network behaviors.
It also includes a set of tools for evaluating and displaying simulation results. Ns-3 is
written in C++ and Python and distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License.
